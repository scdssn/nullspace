## Did you know?
For devices with an AMOLED display (as opposed to one with an LED, LCD, etc.), displaying the color black (ONLY #000000) can help save battery! AMOLED displays turn off pixels when displaying #000000 instead of turning the pixel opaque (where the backlight is still on), hence saving you battery. The color #000000 is a deep, rich black on AMOLED displays as opposed to a washed-out black you see on other screens.

Enjoy the contrast! Save your eyes! Save your battery! Install today!


## FAQ
### Where do I donate?
This is a theme for a note taking application. I do not deserve donations. If you would like to donate, I recommend supporting the development of Standard Notes by buying an Extended membership.
### Who are you?
An avid user of Standard Notes that merely wanted a #000000 theme.
### Can you change the accent color?
You don't like that pretty blue?
Just kidding, sure I can.
Please message me on Reddit (username: ssnsec) or on the Standard Notes Slack page (username: ssnsec) with what you would like the accent color to be.
